This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Time class

The time class has 4 props:

- targetTime: Date - the time the component should present the result relative to
- includeTime: Boolean - if true minimum difference is one second, if false one calendar day
- dynamic: Boolean - if true the component should update automatically at an interval
- displayExtras - I added additional features beyond the requested duration. Set to true to see additional features
